Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): JDK 11 or higher is recommended.

2. Android Studio: The official IDE for Android development. Download it here.

3. Git: For cloning the repository.

Installation
1. Clone the repo:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/mealshare.git```

2. Open in Android Studio:
Launch Android Studio.
On the welcome screen, select "Open" (or File > Open...).
Navigate to the folder where you cloned the mealshare repository and select it.

3. Sync Gradle:
Android Studio will automatically detect the build.gradle files and prompt you to sync the project. This will download all the necessary dependencies.
If it doesn't happen automatically, click the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" icon (looks like an elephant with a down-arrow) in the toolbar.

4. Run the app:
Once the Gradle sync is complete, you can run the app.
Select an emulator (AVD) or connect a physical Android device.
Click the "Run 'app'" button (the green "play" icon) in the top toolbar.
